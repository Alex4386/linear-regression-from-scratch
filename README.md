# Linear-Regression-From-Scratch
My Trial of implementing linear regression on C language.  
Currently trying to implement in [playentry](https://playentry.org/alex4386/5db19092bdc6ae002092b793?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fplayentry.org%2Falex4386%23!%2Fmy_project%3Fsort%3Dupdated%26rows%3D15%26page%3D1%26tab%3Dmy_project%26type%3Dproject) stay tuned.  

## What does it do?
This is a Self-study project of Software Mathematics Course, of [Prof. Jaehyuk Choi](https://sites.google.com/site/chjhsoft/).  
This program uses Gradient Descent method to implement linear regression.  
  
The code was built via the class materials of 2019-1 Software Mathematics, Chapter 7-2. Basics of Calculus.  
  
## But, Why C?
Because, I program better at C than Python.  

## But why are you porting this to [entry](https://playentry.org/)
[As I mentioned on my tweet,](https://twitter.com/Alex4386_dev/status/1187166430401200129) creating ML Framework on Scratch/playentry will give me a "Full Stack Developer" Suit.
