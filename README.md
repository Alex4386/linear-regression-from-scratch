# Linear-Regression-From-Scratch
My Trial of implementing linear regression on C language.

## What does it do?
This is a Self-study project of Software Mathematics Course, of [Prof. Jaehyuk Choi](https://sites.google.com/site/chjhsoft/).  
This program uses Gradient Descent method to implement linear regression.  
  
The code was built via the class materials of 2019-1 Software Mathematics, Chapter 7-2. Basics of Calculus.  
  
## But, Why C?
Because I am program better at C than Python.
